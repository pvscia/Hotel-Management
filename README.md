# Simple Hotel Management System

## A simple application that helps keep track of all your hotel needs, both from a guest perspective and an admin perspective.

This project is built using Java and JavaFX while also integrating a MySQL database, and while remaining simple to navigate, will allow users (both guests and admins) to do the following tasks respectively:

Guests:

* Add ratings to the currently checked-in hotel.
* Book hotel facilities remotely.
* Order additional amenities, such as additional toothbrushes .
* Set a wake-up call time.
* Set room status to do not disturb.

Hotel Admins:

* View room details, such as room capacity, its status (booked or not), etc.
* View reservation details that include the ID of the guest currently checked-in, when they checked-in, and what room they're currently staying at.
* Update and keep track of amenity stocks.
* Update and keep track of the status of hotel facilities, such as the gym or spa.
* View user ratings thus far.
